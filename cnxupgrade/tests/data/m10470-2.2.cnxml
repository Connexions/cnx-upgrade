	<para id="intro">
	    Linux is used a great deal in the computer science and
	    engineering communities.  This is largely because of the
	    wealth of tools available in these problem domains.
	    Engineers and computer scientists have historically relied
	    on various versions of UNIX, so this has been a natural
	    progression.  Here we mention a small subset of the
	    available tools.
	</para>
	<section id="emacs">
	    <name>Emacs</name>
	    <para id="emacs-intro">
		Emacs is a well-known textfile editor originally
		developed for UNIX.  It is a graphical editor, and is
		extremely extensible and configurable.  Emacs is
		configured and extended using a programming language
		(called elisp), which basically means that extensions
		can be arbitrarily powerful.  Emacs' features include
		syntax highlighting, auto-indenting, multiple buffers
		and windows, support for CVS, and many others. 
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section id="vi">
	    <name>VI</name>
	    <para id="vi-intro">
		Vi is another popular editor for UNIX.  It is much
		smaller and less extensible than emacs.  For the
		uninitiated, it is cryptic (you have to type a command
		just to be able to start typing).  However, once you
		learn the relevant commands, it is surprisingly
		powerful.
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section id="make">
	    <name>Make</name>
	    <para id="make-intro">
		Make is an automated tool originally written to for
		recompiling programs based on which files have
		changed.  It has developed into a general-purpose tool
		for satisfying dependencies.  You specify a
		configuration file which contains an encoding of a
		dependency graph and associated commands to execute to
		satisfy a particular dependency.  Then depending on
		which dependencies still need satisfying, make will
		run the respective commands.
	    </para>
	    <example id="make-example">
		<para id="make-example-intro">
		    This is perhaps best-illustrated by an example.
		    Consider the following "Makefile":
		</para>
		<code type='block' id="make-makefile">
prog: prog.o
	gcc prog.o -o prog

prog.o: prog.c
	gcc -c prog.c -o prog.o
		</code>
		<para id="make-example-descr">
		    This is an example showing how to build the
		    program <code>prog</code> from the source
		    file <code>prog.c</code>.  It shows the
		    file <code>prog</code> depending on the
		    intermediate file <code>prog.o</code>, and
		    <code>prog.o</code> depends on
		    <code>prog.c</code>.  If
		    <code>prog.o</code> is out of date
		    relative to its dependencies (that is,
		    <code>prog.c</code>), then it is
		    regenerated using the associated command (that is,
		    <code>gcc -c prog.c -o prog.o</code>). 
		</para>
	    </example>
	</section>
	<section id="cvs">
	    <name>CVS</name>
	    <para id="cvs-intro">
		CVS is a version management system.  It is used as
		backup storage for the current version of a file and
		as a repository for old versions of the file.  It is
		most commonly used to track versions of source code,
		but can also be used for tracking LaTeX documents, web
		pages, and has been used for configuration files as
		well. 
	    </para>
	</section>
	<section id="latex">
	    <name>LaTeX</name>
	    <para id="latex-intro">
		LaTeX is a document-generation system.  It uses
		plaintext source files with mark-up tags to indicate
		how the text should be formatted (a lot like HTML).
		It supports document sectioning, tables, embedded
		figures, and (perhaps most relevant to computer
		scientists and engineers) incredible support for
		mathematical equations, formulas, and theorems.
